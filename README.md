## Introduction

A fully featured C++17 parser, renderer and optimizer for [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/); Shopify's templating language. It's designed to provide official support for using liquid in the following languages:

* C++
* C
* Ruby
* Perl

Other languages (Javascript, Python, etc..) may come later, but any support for them will be unofficial.

## Goals

Here's the overriding philosophy of what I'm aiming for, for this library.

### Modular

All components of the process should be decoupled, and as much control as possible should be transferred to the programmer; nothing should be a monolith.

### Extensible

You should be able to modify almost everything about the way the language behaves by registering new tags, operators, filters, drops, dialects; very little
should be in the core.

### General

There should be no special cases; every instance should be part of a generalizable set of classes, and operators. No direct text parsing, unless you absolutely need to.

### Performant

It should be at least an order of magnitude faster than Ruby liquid, preferably more. It should also use at most an order of magnitude less memory.

### Portable

It should be dead-easy to implement a new language for the parser, which means a really robust and easy-to-use C interface that can access most, if not all parts of the system.

It should also compile on Windows, Mac, and Linux easily.

### Independent

It should have basically no dependencies, other than the C++ standard library itself.

### Conformance

It should pass all Shopify's test suites, and act exactly as Shopify liquid, if configured to do so.

### Insanity at the Edges

That being said, the deficiencies of the Shopify implementation shouldn't hold it back. It should be extremely easy to toggle extra feaatures;
and a single call should permit `permissive` liquid, which allows for things like expression evaluation in all contexts. All things associated
with the ruby version of Liquid, like global state, and whatnot, should exist purely as a fa√ßade pattern in a standalone Ruby module, which
requires an underlying ruby module that implements the more modular, sane version.

## Status

In development. **Do not use in production code, yet.**

Basic memory audits of the core have been done with valgrind, and leaks have been closed. A more extensive battery of tests is required to determine if there's actually any undefined behaviour or further leaks.

### Quick Start

### Building

Building the library is easy; so long as you have the appropriate build-system; currently the library uses cmake to build across platforms.

It can be built and installed like so, from the main directory:

```mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. && make && sudo make install/strip```

Eventually, I'll have a .deb that can be downloaded from somewhere for Ubuntu distros, but that's not quite up yet.

#### C++

The C++ library, which is built with the normal Makefile can be linked in as a static library. Will eventually be available as a header-only library.

```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <liquid/liquid.h>

int(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // The liquid context represents all registered tags, operators, filters, and a way to resolve variables.
    Liquid::Context context;
    // Very few of the bits of liquid are part of the 'core'; instead, they are implemented as dialects. In order to
    // stick in most of the default bits of Liquid, you can ask the context to implement the standard dialect, but this
    // is not necessary. The only default tag available is {% raw %}, as this is less a tag, and more a lexing hint. No
    // filters, or operators, other than the unary - operator, are available by default; they are are all part of the liquid standard dialect.
    // In addition to setting all these nodes up, this also sets the 'truthiness' of variables to evaluted in a loose manner; meaning
    // that in addition to false and nil, being not true; 0, and empty string are also considered not true.
    // In order to implement the stricter Shopify ruby version of things, use `implementStrict` instead.
    Liquid::StandardDialect::implementPermissive(context);
    // In addition, dialects can be layered. Implementing one dialect does not forgo implementating another; and dialects
    // can override one another; whichever dialect was applied last will apply its proper tags, operators, and filters.
    // Currently, there is no way to deregsiter a tag, operator, or filter once registered.

    // Initialize a parser. These should be thread-local. One parser can parse many files.
    Liquid::Parser parser(context);

    const char exampleFile[] = "{% if a > 1 %}123423{% else %}sdfjkshdfjkhsdf{% endif %}";
    // Throws an exception if there's a fatal parsing error. Liquid accepts quite a lot by default, so normally this'll be fine.
    // You can query a vector of errors under `parser.errors`.
    Liquid::Node ast = parser.parseFile(exampleFile, sizeof(exampleFile)-1);
    // Initialize a renderer. These should be thread-local. One renderer can render many templates.
    // Register the standard, out of the box variable implementation that lets us pass a type union'd variant that can hold either a long long, double, pointer, string, vector, or unordered_map<string, ...> .
    Liquid::Renderer renderer(context, CPPVariableResolver());

    Liquid::CPPVariable store;
    store["a"] = 10;

    std::string result = renderer.render(ast, store);
    // Should output "123423"
    fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", result.data());
    return 0;
}
```

This program should be linked with `-lliquid`.

#### C

The following program below is analogous to the one above, only using the external C interface.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <liquid/liquid.h>

int(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    LiquidContext context = liquidCreateContext();
    liquidImplementPermissiveStandardDialect(context);

    LiquidParser parser = liquidCreateParser(context);
    const char exampleFile[] = "{% if a > 1 %}123423{% else %}sdfjkshdfjkhsdf{% endif %}";
    LiquidLexerError lexerError;
    LiquidParserError parserError;
    LiquidTemplate tmpl = liquidParserParseTemplate(parser, examplesFile, sizeof(exampleFile)-1, NULL, &lexerError, &parserError);
    if (lexerError.type) {
        char buffer[512];
        liquidGetLexerErrorMessage(lexerError, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        fprintf(stderr, "Lexer Error: %s\n", buffer);
        exit(-1);
    }
    if (parserError.type) {
        char buffer[512];
        liquidGetParserErrorMessage(parserError, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
        fprintf(stderr, "Parser Error: %s\n", buffer);
        exit(-1);
    }
    // This object should be thread-local.
    LiquidRenderer renderer = liquidCreateRenderer(context);


    // If no LiquidVariableResolver is specified; an internal default is used that won't read anything you pass in, but will funciton for {% assign %}, {% capture %} and other tags.
    /* LiquidVariableResolver resolver = {
        ...
    };

    liquidRegisterVariableResolver(renderer, resolver); */

    // Use something that works with your language here; as resolved by the LiquidVariableResolver above.
    void* variableStore = NULL;
    LiquidTemplateRender result = liquidRenderTemplate(renderer, variableStore, tmpl);
    fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", liquidTemplateRenderGetBuffer(result));

    // All resources, unless otherwise specified, must be free explicitly.
    liquidFreeTemplateRender(result);
    liquidFreeRenderer(renderer);
    liquidFreeTemplate(tmpl);
    liquidFreeContext(context);

    return 0;
}
```

This program should be linked with `-lliquid -lstdc++`.

#### Ruby

The ruby module uses the C interface to interface with the liquid library.

##### Install

Currently the package isn't uploaded on rubygems, so it has to be build manually. Luckily; this is easy:

```cd ruby/liquidcpp && rake compile && rake gem && gem install pkg/*.gem && cd - && cd ruby/liquidc-dir && rake compile && rake gem && gem install pkg/*.gem && cd -```

##### Usage

There're two ways to get the ruby library working. You can use the OO way, which mirrors the C++ API.

```ruby
require 'liquidc'
context = LiquidCPP.new()
parser = LiquidCPP::Parser.new(context)
renderer = LiquidCPP::Renderer.new(context)
template = parser.parse("{% if a %}asdfghj {{ a }}{% endif %}")
puts renderer.render({ "a" => 1 }, template)
```

Or, alternatively, one can use the "drop in replacement" module, which wraps all this, which will register the exact same constructs as the normal `liquid` gem.
The advantage of this is that by simply replacing your require statements, you should be able to use your existing code; but it'll be close to an order of magnitude
faster.

```ruby
require 'liquidcpp-dir'

template = Liquid::Template.parse("{% if a %}asdfghj {{ a }}{% endif %}")
puts template.render({ "a" => 1 }, template)
```

This is generally discouraged, as you lose object-orientation and modularity; like the ability to have independent liquid contexts with different
tags, filters, operators, and settings vs. some weird mishmash where just shove everything into a global namespace, and "act" like you're using some OO.
But, it's of course, up to you.

#### Perl

The perl module uses the C interface to interface with the liquid library, and attempts to mimic `WWW::Shopify::Liquid`.

##### Install

Currently the module hasn't been uploaded to CPAN, but can be built and installed like so;

```cd perl && perl Makefile.PL && make && sudo make install && cd -```

Will eventually upload this.

##### Usage

Uses the exact same interface as `WWW::Shopify::Liquid`, and is basically almost fully compatible with it as `WWW::Shopify::Liquid::XS`.

All core constrcuts are overriden, and there is no optimizer at present, but all top-level functions should work correctly; and most dialects that have tags, filters and operators,
that use `operate` instead of `process` or `render` should function without changes.

```perl
    use WWW::Shopify::Liquid::XS;

    my $liquid = WWW::Shopify::Liquid::XS->new;
    my $text = $liquid->render_file({ }, "myfile.liquid");
    print "$text\n";
```

#### Python

This will probably come around at some point; but currently, there are no bindings for Python.

#### Javascript

This *may* happen. *Maybe*.

## Features / Roadmap

This is what I'm aiming for at any rate.

### Done

* Includes a standard dialect that contains all array, string and math filters by default, as well as all normal operators, and all control flow, iteration and variable tags.
* Significantly less memory usage than ruby-based liquid.
* Contextualized set of filters, operators, and tags per liquid object instantaited; no global state as in the regular Shopify gem, easily allowing for many flavours of liquid in the same process.
* Ability to easily specify additions of filters, operators, and tags called `Dialects`, which can be mixed and matched.
* Small footprint. Aiming for under 5K SLOC, with full standard Liquid as part of the core library.
* Fully featured `extern "C"` interface for easy linking to most scripting languages. OOB bindings for both Ruby and Perl will be provided, that will act as drop-in replacements for `Liquid` and `WWW::Shopify::Liquid`.
* Significant speedup over ruby-based liquid. (Need to do benchmarks; but at first glance seems like a minimum of a 10-20x speedup over regular Liquid for both rendering and parsing)
* Fully compatible with both `Liquid`, Shopify's ruby gem, and `WWW::Shopify::Liquid`, the perl implementation.
* Use a standard build system; like cmake.
* Optional compatibilty with rapidjson to allow for easy JSON reading in C++.
* Line accurate, and helpful error messages.
* Ability to step through and examine the liquid AST.
* In ruby integration, allow for all types of strict/lax modes.
* Allow for tag registration in the drop in replacement module for Ruby.
* Built-in optimizer that will do things like loop unrolling, conditional elimiation, etc..
* Togglable extra features, such as real operators, parentheses, etc..
* Ability to set limits on memory consumed, and time spent rendering.

### Partial

* Full test suite that runs all major examples from Shopify's doucmentation. (Test suite runs some examples, but not all).

### TODO

* Ability to partially render content, then spit back out the remaining liquid that genreated it.
* General polish pass to clean up reundant code, and ensure consistency across the C, C++, Perl and Ruby APIs.
* Write a register-based bytecode compiler/interpreter, which should be significantly faster than walking the parse tree. (not that it really needs it at this point)
